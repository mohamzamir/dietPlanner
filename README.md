# HOW TO RUN

## Step 1: Make virtual environment
Create the **virtual environment**. This is done with the command:
```python3
python3 -m venv venv
```

## Step 2: Download requirements
```python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If ```pip``` doesn't work ```pip3``` should.

## Step 3: Run the file!
```python3
python3 diet_planner.py
```
This may take a while!
